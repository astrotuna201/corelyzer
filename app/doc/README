--- How to Generate Corelyzer Help Files ---
Brian Grivna, August 27, 2012

The help files included with Corelyzer are generated using:

http://docbook.sourceforge.net/
- DocBook XSL stylesheets.

http://xmlsoft.org/xslt/index.html
- The xsltproc command-line utility (part of the XSLT C library).
If you're running a recent version of Mac OS X, you're in luck,
it's likely already installed.

http://javahelp.java.net/
- The JavaHelp system, required to generate the search database.

app/doc/corelyzer.xml
- The "source" file that contains all help text and defines help structure.


To generate help files:

1. Create HTML and JavaHelp files with the following command (in app/doc):

   xsltproc --stringparam section.autolabel 1 \
            --stringparam section.label.includes.component.label 1 \
            --stringparam suppress.navigation 0 \
            [DocBook root]/javahelp/javahelp.xsl corelyzer.xml

The stringparams assign section numbers, prefix those section numbers with
chapter numbers, and include the Prev/Next navigation header/footer, respectively.

app/doc should now contain several HTML files and the following JavaHelp files:
    jhelpidx.xml jhelpmap.jhm jhelpset.hs jhelptoc.xml


2. Create the JavaHelp search database (in app/doc):

   [JavaHelp root]/javahelp/bin/jhindexer *.html

app/doc should now contain a directory called JavaHelpSearch.


3. Copy the contents of app/doc (sans README and corelyzer.xml) to 
packages/base/help, repackage the app, and bask in the helpfulness!
