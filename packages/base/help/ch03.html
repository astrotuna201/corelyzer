        Before we start Corelyzer, we must first make sure our display
        settings are correct. On both the Mac and Windows, the default
        monitor should be the &#8220;upper left most monitor&#8221;.
      </p><div class="sect2" title="3.1.1. Microsoft Windows Users"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id36149089"></a>3.1.1. Microsoft Windows Users</h3></div></div></div><p>
          To setup the monitors on Windows, you must first go to your
          "Display". You can do this by going to the Start
          menu, selecting "Control Panel" and double-clicking on
          "Display".

          </p><div class="figure"><a name="id36149098"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 3.1. Display in Control Panel</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/windows_controlpanel.png" alt="Display in Control Panel"></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
        </p><p>
          Once opened, please go to the Settings tab. Here you will
          see boxes with numbers representing the monitors connected
		  to your machine. If you have a
          monitor that is not displaying your desktop then it will
          show up as a slightly grayed-out box, indicating this monitor
		  is disabled. If the box
          indicates the monitor is disabled and you click on the box,
          you will be able to modify the options for that monitor. To
          enabled the monitor, make sure that the check box next to
          Extend my desktop... is checked. Do this for all the
          monitors you would like to use, presumably all of them. Once
          you have done that, click on the Apply button. If you did
          this correctly, your desktop should be visible on all
          the monitors. 
          
          </p><div class="figure"><a name="id36149120"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 3.2. Display</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/windows_displayproperties.png" alt="Display"></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
        </p><p>
          Note: Some monitors need to be turned off and on again to
          realize that they are enabled by Windows. Now that the
          desktops are visible on your monitors, you will need to set
          the display resolution for all of the monitors. Corelyzer
          requires that all monitors use the same resolution. Example resolutions
          are 1280x1024 and 1600x1200. There is a slider on your
          display settings dialog to modify the resolution. Once set
          for all monitors, click on the Apply button again. If you
          are prompted to restart your machine in order for the
          changes to take affect, then do so. Otherwise, the
          resolution of your monitors will change and you will be
          prompted to keep the settings or change them back. 
        </p><p>
          Note: If your monitors do not support a particular
          resolution they will likely display that or they will stay
          black. If you do not like your settings, wait for some time
          and Windows will revert back. After you have enabled your
          monitors and configured their display settings, you should
          make sure that the layout of the monitors matches the layout
          of the boxes in your display settings. First we need to
          identify which box represents which monitor, and we can do
          this by seeing what number has been assigned to each monitor
          by Windows. To do this, click on the Identify button. When
          you do this, your monitors will display a number indicating
          which box refers to which monitor. If your monitors are
          ordered differently than the boxes that are shown on your
          display settings, then you will need to re-arrange your
          monitors. This is easily done by clicking and dragging the
          boxes in your settings window. Again, you should make sure
          that the upper left most box matches with your upper left
          most monitor and that monitor is enabled as your Primary
          Monitor.
        </p><p>
          Note that the desktop numbering in Microsoft Windows
          depends on the order in which you've connected monitors to
          your graphics card(s). It may not appear in ascending
          order from left to right. All you have to make sure is the
          ordering is matched in the onscreen identify result and the
          display properties display, as shown in the following two
          screenshots.

          To setup your monitors on your Mac you will need to get to
          the display settings. To do this, open the Apple menu in the
		  upper-left of the screen and select "System Preferences". Then
          choose "Displays" and you will see a dialog window on each
          monitor that is connected to your machine.

          </p><div class="figure"><a name="id36149178"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 3.5. Displays setup in System Preferences</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/mac_displays.png" alt="Displays setup in System Preferences"></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
        </p><p>
          Make sure the display resolution on each monitor is the
          same. After fixing the resolution, go to your main window
          and select the "Arrangement" tab. You will then see a layout
          of boxes that indicate how your monitors are laid
          out. Unfortunately there is no way to identify which monitor
          is represented by which box, as you can on Windows. You will
          need to arrange the boxes to match your monitor arrangement.
        </p><p>
          You will have to make sure the upper left
          most monitor in your arrangement will be the main
          monitor. On the Mac, the main monitor is visible in the
          Arrangement tab as the box that contains a white rectangle
          along the top of the box. To designate a different monitor
          to be the main monitor, simply drag the white rectangle to
          the box that should be the main monitor. This white
          rectangle is actually the menu bar you see on top of your
          monitor. Once the rectangle has been moved, the menu bar
          will also move.

          If you are making a presentation then you may want to mirror
          your display, but normally you don't want to mirror your
          display so that you will have more screen real estate to
          view your core images and data.
