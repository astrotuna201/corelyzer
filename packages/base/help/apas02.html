        Here we will discuss about how to make sure a core image has
        the correct DPI. At this point, let's assume that your
        digital-line-scanner scans the core at 100 dots per
        centimeter. This is equal to 254 DPI.
      </p><p>
        The first thing to do is open the image in a program like
        Adobe Photoshop, or The Gimp. At this point, we will assume
        that you are working with Photoshop.
      </p><p>
        In Photoshop, you will want to view the image's properties by
        going to Image -&gt; Image Size. A dialog will appear showing the
        image width, height, etc. If the resolution does not match the
        expected DPI then we will need to change it. Before doing that
        make sure that the Resample Image checkbox is
        unchecked. Otherwise, when you change the DPI of the image,
        the image will get resized. After you uncheck the Resample
        Image option, edit the Resolution text field and enter the
        correct DPI. At the time of this writing, most core section
        images have a DPI of 254.
      </p><p>
        If you realize that more than one image contains the wrong
        DPI, you can create a batch process in Photoshop to help you
        deal with all the images.
