		Before you proceed, make sure you know the following properties of the images to be loaded:

        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Orientation: Are the images horizontally or vertically oriented?
		  For horizontally-oriented images, depth is assumed to increase from left to right.
		  For vertically-oriented images, top to bottom.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Resolution: What's the resolution of the images in dots-per-inch (DPI)?
		  </p></li></ul></div><p>
		
		Corelyzer requires these properties to process and render section images at the correct scale.
    </p><p>
		How do you determine the DPI of your image? This depends on the equipment in which the image was
		retrieved. Most line-scan cameras that are manufactured
		for the creation of high-resolution images of core sections indicate DPI on their packaging,
		but it seems that many don't save in the expected DPI. One method of ensuring a correct DPI is described in
		<a class="ulink" href="apas02.html" target="_top">Making Sure the DPI of an Image is Correct</a>. When loading images
		you can also specify the length of a core section image, from which Corelyzer
		can calculate the appropriate DPI value.
	</p><div class="sect1" title="5.1. Load images from local files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id36149886"></a>5.1. Load images from local files</h2></div></div></div><p>
			To start the image loading process, select the menu item "File &gt; Load Images &gt; Open
			Local Image Files...". Choose the files you wish to load in the resulting dialog:
			
			</p><div class="figure"><a name="id36149895"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 5.1. Select image files to load</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/loadImages-1.png" alt="Select image files to load"></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
		</p><p>
			By default, Corelyzer displays core imagery by placing section
			images in horizontal tracks. Each track corresponds to a single hole.
			After images to load are selected, Corelyzer will attempt to organize these images
			into new and/or existing tracks based on image filenames and existing track names
			(if present). The following dialog displays the suggested
			organization and allows the user to modify it as needed.
			
			</p><div class="figure"><a name="id36149914"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 5.2. Arrange loaded image files</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/loadImages-2.png" alt="Arrange loaded image files"></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
			
			In Figure 5.2, note that the seven loaded sections have been organized into three tracks.
			Tracks are indicated by "Track" prefixing their name and a beige background.
			Note that all sections and tracks have a green dot to their left indicating that
			they've just been loaded (sections) or created (tracks). Most operations in this
			dialog apply only to these new tracks and sections. To adjust the structure and
			arrangement of tracks and sections, use the buttons described below:
			
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Move Up/Down: Move selected sections up/down within a track or between tracks.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Delete: Remove selected section or track from the list. Tracks containing
				sections cannot be deleted until emptied.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Rename Track: Rename selected track.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>New Track: Create a new track.</p></li></ul></div><p>
			
			Once the arrangement of sections and tracks is satisfactory, input your images' DPI values
			in the DPI X/Y fields.  Because DPI X and DPI Y are almost always the same, the value
			entered	in the X field will be immediately copied into the Y field if it's blank. Orientation
			defaults to Horizontal, change it to Vertical if necessary. Now that image properties and 
			section order have been established, Corelyzer can place sections in appropriate tracks and
			position them end-to-end. To proceed, click the "Next &gt;" button.
			
			The	resulting dialog allows the user to review and modify image properties, if necessary:
			
			</p><div class="figure"><a name="id36149955"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 5.3. Set image properties</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/loadImages-3.png" alt="Set image properties"></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
			
			As you can see in the (rightmost) Depth column, the first three sections start from depth
			zero: each is the first section in a new track.  The last four sections are part of the
			third track: each is placed	at the bottommost depth of the preceding section.

			</p><p>
			The section image properties can be modified individually by selecting the cell you wish to change and
			hitting the Return/Enter key, or by double-cliking the desired cell.  To modify
			a value(s) for multiple sections, you can use the Batch Input controls below the section
			property table. Check the "Batch input..." checkbox to enable the controls, and enter
			the desired settings. If you want to apply these settings to all sections in the table,
			click the Apply to All Rows button. If you want to apply these settings only to certain
			sections, select those sections in the section property table, then click the Apply to 
			Selected Rows button. In both cases, only populated fields will modify the corresponding
			table cells.
			</p><p>
			
			</p><p>
			If you modify DPI values on the depth axis (DPI X for horizontal images, DPI Y
			for vertical), section lengths and depths will be updated automatically so sections
			in each track are positioned end-to-end when loaded.
			</p><p>

			</p><p>
			When you are satisfied with the image properties, click the Finish button.
			Corelyzer will begin loading images with the specified parameters.
			</p><p>
		
			</p><p>
			Once completed, the visualization window will display core images
			and the Section listbox in the main session/iCores window will update with the image
			filenames loaded in each track. Notice in the image below that the ruler in the core image
			closely matches the depth measurements at the bottom of
			the visualization window. This visual check is an excellent way to confirm the
			proper DPI values were used.
